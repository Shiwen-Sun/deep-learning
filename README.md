## Syllabus

This class covers deep learning in a total of 24 hours over 5 weeks. We start
with simple multi-layer perceptrons, backpropogation, and gradient descent,
exploring at the fundamental aspects of deep learning in depth. We cover a wide
range of deep learning topics, from Natural Language Processing to Generative
Adversarial Networks; the full schedule is below. The goal is that students
understand the capacities of deep learning, the current state of the field, and
the challenges of using and developing deep learning algorithms. By the end of
this class, we expect students that students will be able to understand recent
literature in deep learning, implement novel neural network architectures, use
and understand the PyTorch library in many ways, and apply deep learning to
different domains.
